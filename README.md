## How It Works

### Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages (MA20, MA50)**: Trend analysis and momentum
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Momentum oscillator (0-100)
- **Volatility**: 20-day rolling standard deviation for risk assessment
- **Price Trends**: Direction and strength analysis

### Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (150 estimators for enhanced version)
- **Features**: Open, High, Low, Volume, MA20, MA50, RSI, Volatility, Sentiment
- **Training**: 80/20 train/test split with StandardScaler normalization
- **Prediction**: Next day's closing price with accuracy metrics

### Sentiment Analysis
- **News Sentiment**: Analysis of news headlines and articles
- **Social Media Sentiment**: Social media buzz and sentiment tracking
- **Stock-Specific Weighting**: Different sentiment sensitivity for different stocks
- **Tesla Enhancement**: 40% sentiment weight for highly volatile stocks

### Enhanced Scoring System (0-9 points)
| Criteria | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Price above 20-day MA | +1 | Short-term bullish trend |
| Price above 50-day MA | +1 | Medium-term bullish trend |
| 20-day MA above 50-day MA | +1 | Moving average crossover signal |
| RSI in healthy range (30-70) | +1 | Not overbought/oversold |
| Lower than average volatility | +1 | Reduced risk |
| ML predicts price increase | +2 | Model confidence boost |
| Positive sentiment | +1-2 | News and social sentiment |
| High trading volume | +1 | Volume confirmation |

### Smart Recommendation Logic
The system prioritizes ML predictions and sentiment over technical scores:

```python
if predicted_price < current_price:
    price_drop = ((current_price - predicted_price) / current_price) * 100
    # Factor in sentiment for volatile stocks
    if symbol in sentiment_sensitive_stocks and sentiment_score < -0.1:
        price_drop *= 1.2  # Amplify negative sentiment impact
    
    if price_drop > 5: recommendation = "STRONG SELL"
    elif price_drop > 2: recommendation = "SELL"
    else: recommendation = "HOLD" if score >= 3 else "SELL"
else:
    # Positive sentiment boost for sentiment-sensitive stocks
    if symbol in sentiment_sensitive_stocks and sentiment_score > 0.15:
        score += 1
    
    if score >= 7: recommendation = "STRONG BUY"
    elif score >= 5: recommendation = "BUY"
    elif score >= 3: recommendation = "HOLD"
    else: recommendation = "SELL"
```

### Investment Recommendations
- **STRONG BUY**: Score 7-9 points - High confidence buy signal
- **BUY**: Score 5-6 points - Moderate buy signal  
- **HOLD**: Score 3-4 points - Neutral, maintain position
- **SELL**: Score 1-2 points - Sell signal or avoid
- **STRONG SELL**: Score 0 points or significant predicted drop
